This includes your full name, email, phone number, mailing address, and any other details submitted via forms, newsletter subscriptions, or service requests. This information enables us to communicate effectively, tailor offerings to your needs, and provide you with exceptional service. Your data is kept confidential and never sold or shared for third-party marketing without explicit consent. Accuracy and timeliness of the information you provide help us serve you better. You may withdraw consent or update your information anytime, ensuring control over your data.</p>

<h3>2. Automated Data Collection via Website Interaction</h3>
<p>As you browse our website, we collect certain technical data such as IP address, device type, browser, pages visited, and time spent using cookies and similar technologies. These help us enhance user experience by remembering preferences, analyzing user behavior for improvements, and providing personalized content. You can control cookie settings via your browser, but disabling some may affect site functionality. We do not track your behavior across other sites and do not employ invasive profiling. This data is aggregated, anonymized, and handled per relevant laws to maintain your privacy.</p>

<h3>3. Information Received from Third Parties</h3>
<p>Occasionally, we receive information about you from trusted third parties such as analytics providers or marketing partners. These third parties adhere to strict privacy and security standards complying with applicable laws. Any data shared is used solely to improve our services and your experience. We do not purchase data for unsolicited marketing, and data sharing always respects your privacy preferences. You retain the right to request information on how your data from third parties is used. Transparency and security govern all such relationships.</p>

<h3>4. Use and Purpose of Collected Data</h3>
<p>Your personal data is used to provide, manage, and improve our services including responding to inquiries, scheduling consultations, processing transactions, and offering relevant updates and offers. We never share or sell your personal data for third-party marketing without explicit consent. Anonymized data is used internally for analytics to better understand customer needs and improve our offerings. We maintain your rights to control communications and keep your data securely processed in alignment with legal standards.</p>

<h3>5. Data Retention and Disposal</h3>
<p>We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill our service obligations and comply with legal, regulatory, or contractual requirements. Retention durations vary accordingly; financial documents are kept per tax laws, while promotional data is held only as long as you permit. Upon expiry of retention periods or your deletion requests, data is securely erased or anonymized. This ensures your privacy is protected throughout the data lifecycle, balancing legal compliance and your rights.</p>

<h3>6. Data Security Measures</h3>
<p>We implement advanced security measures including encryption, access control, secure servers, firewalls, and regular security audits to protect your data. Our staff undergo continuous privacy and security training. Third-party service providers are vetted for strict compliance. These steps help mitigate risks from unauthorized access or data breaches and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your personal information.</p>
